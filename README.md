# BeerJS Oslo

# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. THE DETAILS ARE NOT YET FINAL.

BeerJS Oslo is for devs to get together, throw a few back, and work on their own projects.

## Want to hang out?

We usually meet up on the ??? every month at [FINN.no's offices][finn].

Events are scheduled on the [BeerJS Oslo Meetup group][meetup].

## Want to share something?

If you want to share something with everyone else, let us know in advance! We'll set up a space for presentations.

## Want to bring beer?

Sure you do! We sponsor some beer, but you're welcome to bring your own. Keep in mind that we will move to [Brygg][brygg] after a while, so don't bring too much!
